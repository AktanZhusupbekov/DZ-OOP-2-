thermalInsulation: A String describing the type of thermal insulation (e.g., "insulation", "none").
facade: A String representing the material of the facade (e.g., "brick", "glass").
Methods
displayInfo(): Prints information about the building, including its foundation, number of emergency exits, thermal insulation, and facade.
calculateEstimatedCost(): Calculates an estimated construction cost based on the foundation type.
